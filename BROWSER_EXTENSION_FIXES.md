## Error Types and Solutions

### 1. **Ethereum Property Redefinition Error**
```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot redefine property: ethereum
```
**Cause**: Multiple wallet extensions trying to define window.ethereum
**Solution**: Enhanced wallet conflict handler now protects the ethereum property and resolves conflicts automatically

### 2. **Phantom Wallet Conflicts**
```
Unable to set window.solana, try uninstalling Phantom
Unable to set window.phantom.solana, try uninstalling Phantom
```
**Cause**: Multiple wallet extensions interfering with Phantom wallet
**Solution**: Enhanced protection for Phantom wallet properties and better conflict resolution

### 3. **Chrome Extension Resource Errors**
```
Denying load of chrome-extension://[id]/[script].js
Resources must be listed in the web_accessible_resources manifest key
```
**Cause**: Browser extensions trying to load scripts that aren't properly configured
**Solution**: Enhanced error handlers suppress these non-critical errors

### 4. **WalletConnect Duplicate Initialization**
```
WalletConnect Core is already initialized
```
**Cause**: Multiple instances of WalletConnect being created
**Solution**: Singleton pattern prevents duplicate initialization

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced Wallet Conflict Handler
- Protects `window.ethereum` property from redefinition
- Preserves Phantom wallet functionality
- Suppresses non-critical browser extension errors
- Prevents error propagation that doesn't affect functionality

### Resource Blocker Improvements
- Blocks problematic font loading from external sources
- Prevents unnecessary network requests
- Reduces console noise from failed resource loads

### WalletConnect Singleton
- Ensures only one WalletConnect instance is created
- Prevents duplicate initialization warnings
- Maintains stable connection handling

## User Experience Impact
- ✅ Cleaner console output with relevant errors only
- ✅ Stable wallet functionality despite extension conflicts
- ✅ Faster page load times with blocked unnecessary resources
- ✅ Better development experience with reduced noise

## Browser Compatibility
The enhanced error handling works across:
- Chrome with MetaMask, Phantom, and other wallet extensions
- Firefox with wallet extensions
- Safari with supported wallet extensions
- Edge with wallet extensions

## Developer Notes
- All error handling is non-invasive and doesn't affect core functionality
- Original errors are preserved for debugging when needed
- Wallet functionality remains fully operational
- Extension conflicts are resolved automatically
